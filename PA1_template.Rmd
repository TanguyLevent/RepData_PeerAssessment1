## Loading and preprocessing the data

Data are download from this website [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip), store on my folder (don't
forget to change your working directory on RStudio) as the name of **"Activity.csv"** .

Time to call your data on RStudio and clean it by removing the missing values :

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", na.strings = "NA")
total_NA <- sum(is.na(activity)) # Already store my sum of Missing Value for forward
activity <- na.omit(activity) # Remove Missing values from my dataset  

head(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
